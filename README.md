Like its namesake from Malay ("Saka" meaning ghost), SakaDev works invisibly yet effectively within your development environment, moving seamlessly between files and systems to accomplish complex tasks. This AI ghost developer integrates directly with your CLI and editor, providing an ethereal presence that enhances rather than disrupts your workflow. 

Powered by [Claude 4 Sonnet's agentic capabilities](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet), it handles software development tasks with precision and reliability. Through its powerful toolset, SakaDev creates and edits files, analyzes projects, interacts with browsers, and executes terminal commands, all with a secure approval system. Going beyond code completion, it uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to extend its capabilities through custom tools. This combination of powerful automation and controlled oversight makes SakaDev an essential companion for professional software development.

How it works:

1. **Task Initiation**: Submit your task with optional images or screenshots to guide the process.

2. **Project Analysis**: SakaDev analyzes your codebase through:
   - File structure examination
   - Source code AST parsing
   - Targeted regex searches
   - Efficient context management

3. **Intelligent Execution**: With comprehensive project understanding, SakaDev:
   - Creates and edits files with automatic error detection and fixing
   - Executes terminal commands with real-time output monitoring
   - Performs browser-based testing and debugging when needed

4. **Task Completion**: Upon completion, SakaDev provides:
   - A summary of changes made
   - Verification steps if needed
   - One-click command execution to view results

> [!TIP]
> Use the `CMD/CTRL + Shift + P` shortcut to open the command palette and type "SakaDev: Open In New Tab" to open the extension as a tab in your editor. This lets you use SakaDev side-by-side with your file explorer, and see how he changes your workspace more clearly.
