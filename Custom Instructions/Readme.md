  - Language-specific best practices

- Project Organization
  - File naming standards
  - Directory structures
  - Resource management

- Testing Standards
  - Unit test generation
  - Integration test protocols
  - Coverage requirements

- Workflow Automation
  - Common task handling
  - Development pipeline optimization
  - Process standardization

- Quality Assurance
  - Code readability standards
  - Maintainability guidelines
  - Performance optimization rules
